# Java Brute Force Password Simulator

This Java project simulates a controlled brute-force password attack for educational purposes and ethical hacking practice.

## Features
- Ethical hacking simulation of password attacks
- Tracks number of password attempts
- Demonstrates importance of strong, complex passwords
- Strengthens understanding of credential access vulnerabilities

## Languages & Tools
- Java
- MacOS compatible

## Usage
1. Compile: `javac BruteForce.java`
2. Run: `java BruteForce`
3. Enter password guesses until the correct password is found

## Cybersecurity Relevance
This project demonstrates how attackers could attempt to brute-force passwords in a controlled environment.  
It emphasizes the importance of password complexity and aligns with MITRE ATT&CK techniques for **Credential Access**: [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/).
